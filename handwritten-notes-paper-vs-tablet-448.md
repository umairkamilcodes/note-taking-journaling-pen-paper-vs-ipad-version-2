today we want to talk about the difference between a paper notebook the remarkable to and an iPad or you can also replace them with other handwriting tablets because that&#39;s the key here and why this might be an obstacle for many busy professionals out there to get the most out of their productivity system at work and having a high performing team supporting their work we will talk about note taking and what you do with the notes later on about different information types and a lot more subtlety today that might give you a different perspective on what you&#39;re doing on a daily basis when you&#39;re taking notes so let&#39;s dive in paperless movement your productivity your way okay here we have a paper notebook the remarkable and the iPad and what do all these have in common well most people love these devices because they can do handwriting for notes and it&#39;s scientifically proven that if you do handwritten notes you will remember things a lot better then you do type text it&#39;s also a lot more friendly sitting in the meeting and taking notes on your notebook rather than typing it into a laptop and you&#39;re sitting behind the screen these are all valid points why you could and should use these devices the thing is for many it stops there either there&#39;s just one notebook uh everything is collected in here in different folders or in the iPad as well if people are using Apple notes notability good notes there&#39;s always a folder structure or Sometimes using tags for organization but the key understanding that is important for this video today is that let&#39;s frame this here and what I want to point out is that you are here in the personal space that&#39;s your personal work and I&#39;m not talking about you know your journaling or something like that I&#39;m really talking about work okay so personal work notes this is what this is all about so this means you&#39;re sitting in a meeting you&#39;re taking notes somebody come comes in you meet somebody on a floor they tell you something you want to scribble things down all these things make total sense and people ask me as I was talking about a lot about Apple noes on this channel as well Tom where&#39;s Apple noes now on your IO framework let&#39;s quickly have a look on our website there&#39;s our IO framework and here you see I&#39;m not going into detail for the io framework now however what you see here is PKM the personal Knowledge Management Area and here is reader the read later app from read Dev tana and heab base but there is no Apple notes so what the heck is going on here and the thing is we are here in this part of the io framework in a personal space and here is the business space where you have the bkm the business Knowledge Management and this is the knowledge that is shared with the team again I&#39;m not going too much into detail let me know in the comments below if you want to have another video about this when you scroll down however you see now in the utility app that Apple noes appears and I consider Apple noes as an intermediate note taking app so what this means let&#39;s go back to our map so when I&#39;m using Apple notes with the iPad and this applies to any of the other things even a piece of paper I&#39;m perfectly able to use a post it take some notes down and still be efficient and that&#39;s the importance of understanding where is the final destination of my information okay now I just brought in the tools here that I&#39;m using and we can bring in apple nodes to this section here and these are still personal work notes related okay so the key is Tom why are you using so many different tools for not taking isn&#39;t this confusing No in fact it&#39;s confusing if I would just use one not taking app right now there is no allinone PKM solution personal Knowledge Management solution that can cover all the different areas of our productivity of a personal knowledge management system as we Define it in iore so if you watch the PKM like a pro course in your iore journey in a membership then you know that we differentiate between shallow thinking and deep thinking so this means understanding this we Define already that in our setup and it might be different for you that&#39;s the beauty about iore it&#39;s tool agnostic it applies to any tools that you have the only thing that you need to do is give it a definition what for you&#39;re using the tools and what kind of information you&#39;re storing in these tools so tana and Rita to us are shallow thinking while heab base is deep thinking and in fact when it comes to brainstorming then we can add one more tool to deep thinking which is Miro the tool that I&#39;m using in order to show you right now these Concepts okay so especially when it comes to team brainstorming uh we are using mirror a lot but heab base is really for personal deep thinking right now Al they&#39;re working on a collaboration feature as well so why do we still have this in place some people get the feeling that I&#39;m saying we shouldn&#39;t use these at all it makes no sense and in fact they do make sense I&#39;m not against using a remarkable all I&#39;m saying is the remarkable is much closer to a piece of paper then it is to the digital world where I can leverage Digital Data remarkable not even has a handwriting search Global search feature yes we have handwriting to text conversion and remarkable but we don&#39;t have a global search so this means I&#39;m not able to search for keywords and it will find the notes that I have taken and that&#39;s to me the same as in a paper notebook where whereas in a paper notebook I&#39;m much faster going through the pages than I I&#39;m navigating in a remarkable that&#39;s personal preference yes it&#39;s distraction free and all this but the next step is the iPad where you have the advantage of a global search especially with no matter the not taking apps that you&#39;re using right now Apple notes is the free native one but there are many others and all of them allow you to search for certain keywords and it will find these notes and highlight them so that makes it much easier to access them then this is especially important when it comes to using these devices as your only PKM however I don&#39;t care because I could use even a piece of paper with my whole system why because I have routines that ensure that I process my information in the right way every day so I can use any intermediate tool as I said even a posted but I need to ensure that there will be a situation on the day where I process this information further into the Final Destination so you can consider these two boxes here the final destinations the whole thing is the personal work notes and here let&#39;s to make the things easier the Final Destination and that&#39;s really now the key understanding you see now even that I&#39;m using Apple nodes for quick nodes to have friction less no taking I&#39;m able to find any information in the tools that I really use so this allows me to switch anything here so let&#39;s name them the intermediate notetaking tools so this means I can interchange these tools however I know that I need to process them in here this means I&#39;m also not worried if I&#39;m losing the paper notebook or if Apple notes goes away because I know that all information that is in there is either irrelevant because I just took down a note like writing down quickly a phone number that I need to call back and then I never use it again there&#39;s no point cluttering up my core systems with information like this I will use information I will to will use tools for this like the iPad or a piece of paper right and I also don&#39;t have to think about okay where do I write down this uh phone number now because I have a fancy PKM system no it doesn&#39;t matter you just write it down and you forget it if there is anything going on that you need to process in Apple notes at least I can add a hashtag even with handwriting saying inbox the moment I enter my routine during the day where I process my inboxes and there are several in different systems that I need to process then I will go to Apple notes search for the hasht Inbox and then process these notes into the final destinations this might be also then the action systems so let&#39;s go here right in the action systems we are right now using clickup and to-do list and if if there is anything that I scribbled down very quickly in a meeting and I know that&#39;s an action point I will process this into the Action System to make it in the core Action System so that&#39;s another danger in apple noes for example you can create tasks in this also in Tana you can create tasks even in heab base you can create tasks but these tasks are again just intermediate steps before we move them into the Action System the actual project management system so we always end up with a single source of Truth for the specific type of information so single source of Truth might be confusing as it sounds like there&#39;s only one place for everything but in fact it&#39;s several places several single source of truths for different types of information a task could be for example a single source of Truth for itself so this means when I have a meeting and we talk about a certain task I could note down quickly something in my intermediate notching tool but then I go back to my desk open up the core application or the project management tool and then I update the data inside the task with the new information so the task itself is always the single source of Truth so whenever I need to work on this task and I go to this task everything is ready I don&#39;t have to look at different systems and find scattered information no everything is already in this task that&#39;s why it&#39;s important to funnel the information into the right directions now you could say well what about these if you have a final destination there and there&#39;s task relevant and stuff well you just add the link to the item from heab base or from Tana to the task so therefore you will be always able to open up this additional information in your personal system even if you&#39;re working with a team that could be possible if you make a note a personal link by me nobody will be able to enter this information but you but the moment you need to work on this task you instantly at the right systems and you find the relevant information and I think that&#39;s a key misunderstanding that people people think I only need one noing app I need just one project management tool and it&#39;s insane with our Inner Circle members especially who are busy professionals managing several teams several businesses even or working in big corporates there&#39;s often a lack of a project management system or a business Knowledge Management System so this means each team member having their own personal bubbles where they keep their information enclosed in silos and then they come together to project meeting where everybody shares their information they update each other the project manager tries to make some notes sends out meeting notes via the email and this email gets dumped in the archive later on two weeks later you have the same meeting talking about the same things again people give the updates again the problem is especially as a project manager you never get the bird&#39;s eyee view on what is going on by implementing the io methodology in these systems you enable the whole team to see exactly what needs to to be done right now and where&#39;s the information that you need in order to get it done and this is the real efficiency boost there are so many studies out there showing that most of the day work is work about work looking for information asking people for the information things like that and what do these people do they open up their paper notebook they look into they&#39;re remarkable or they go to the Apple notes and so yeah yeah last week I I took these notes about this didn&#39;t you remember well I wrote up something else in my notebook and this is the craziness going on when it comes to business it might be different for students and knowledge workers working on their own Freelancers working for themselves you might be okay with this but if you&#39;re a busy professional working on several projects a day and as we do hundreds of tasks per week then this system will crumble it&#39;s no longer efficient enough to just have a paper notebook or something like that if things are not in order there might be the situation that you are leading the company your manager and everything is delegated properly and you&#39;re just getting reports from the other team managers telling you updates that would be the best case situation so because in this moment you might just use a paper notebook or a remarkably or something to write down some personal insights things like that but you will never need this to look up what was actually going on in this project because everything is in a single source of Truth you know what system you could go to in order to see exactly the status of of the project and things like that but this is really rare that&#39;s what we establish in many companies with our IO methodology and this is a real game changer once you get the full picture of how things are going working so if you go for example the in a PKM like a pro course we talk about the Knowledge Management cycle and in there we cover the Discover capture process action and share steps and when we talk about intermediate steps this is where the random s stuff appears and you know exactly where to place this however this is a step just before that you discover something and you cannot quickly access your final PM because too much friction notion is a good example hea base as well it&#39;s very hard to quickly open up the tool you know you need to have a device to access it maybe it&#39;s not mobile friendly then you go there where do I place this I have to create something that&#39;s where you have an intermediate tool like a piece of paper remarkable Apple notes where you chot this quickly down and then calmly when you back on your desk and you have access to your final destination the final PKM then you calmly process this information into your PKM another Advantage is that you already refining and Distilling what you just shot down into the final system so it&#39;s much cleaner in your system you not cluttering up the system you see there are a lot of subtleties and if you have specific use cases share them with us in the comments below I&#39;m happy to make followup videos to discuss specific use cases and if you really need help with your productivity system then look no further join us in a pist movement membership and go through the io journey and learn everything you need to build your
